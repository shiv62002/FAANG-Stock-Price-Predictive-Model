## 📌 Overview

The FAANG companies have shaped global technology, consumer behavior, and financial markets for over a decade. Their sustained market dominance has attracted large investment interest and raised key questions:

- *How have these companies evolved financially?*  
- *What factors influenced historical price movements?*  
- *Can past performance guide future predictions?*  

To explore this, we analyzed **2013–2024 financial and stock market data** and developed a model to interpret historical price changes and project future stock performance.

## 🔍 What This Project Does

- Collects and analyzes FAANG stock values and fiscal revenue data  
- Calculates **annual stock price changes** to normalize year-to-year comparisons  
- Builds a predictive model to **estimate future pricing behavior**  
- Visualizes long-term trends to highlight **key growth inflection points**  

Our goal is to better understand how FAANG companies reached their market position — and what their financial trajectory may look like moving forward.
