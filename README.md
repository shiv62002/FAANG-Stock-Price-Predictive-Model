In light of the surge of FAANG's dominance within the tech sector of investment, our project seeks to develop a tool to conduct predictive analysis of Meta, Amazon, Netflix, and Google's stock values. Throughout our model, we cover data from the year 2013 up until 2024, utilizing data such as the stock values as well as Fiscal Annual Revenue between the given time frame. In order to develop more comprehensive data, we calculated the year change in the stock prices for each company in order to acquire a cleaner data set for the sake of more efficient and accurate computations and interpretations of the stocks' performances. 
The goal of our analysis project is to demonstrate an understanding of how these companies have evolved in terms of their profit and stock pricing. We are accomplishing this by utilizing the data that is available to us in order to provide an understanding of how these companies will perform in the future.
